Project: Brad Traversy's Udemy Course, "MERN Stack Front To Back: Full Stack React, Redux & Node.js"

This is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) web application. The application is a course project for Brad Traversy's Udemy course on the MERN stack. In this implementation, I've departed from the course methodology in a number of areas, so, the code here will not exactly match the code in Brad's repository.
